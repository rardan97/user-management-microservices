# Simple Microservices â€“ User Management (Spring Boot + WebFlux + PostgreSQL)

This project implements a simple microservices architecture for user management using Spring Boot, WebFlux, and PostgreSQL.

---

## Architecture Overview

This project implements a **Simple Microservices** architecture with **Direct Client-to-Microservice Communication**, featuring an aggregation layer inside the `user-service`.

### How it works:

- Each microservice (`user-service`, `department-service`, `address-service`) runs independently on its own server and port, with its own database.
- Clients (frontend apps, Postman, etc.) can access each service directly via its REST API, without an API Gateway or Backend-for-Frontend (BFF).
- `user-service` uses WebClient (Spring WebFlux) to fetch department and address data from other services, aggregating them before returning to the client.

### Summary of key points:

| Feature                | Description                                            |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Services               | Independent apps with own DB and ports                |
| Client communication   | Direct REST calls to each service                     |
| Inter-service comm.    | HTTP via WebClient/WebFlux inside `user-service`      |
| Aggregation            | `user-service` aggregates department & address data   |
| API Gateway            | Not used                                               |

## Services Overview

- **service-user**: CRUD for user data, uses Spring Boot WebFlux and aggregates department & address info from other services.
- **service-department**: CRUD for department data.
- **service-address**: CRUD for address data.

Each service is self-contained, with its own database and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## Communication Model

**Direct Client-to-Microservice Communication**

Clients (e.g. frontend apps, Postman) communicate directly with each microservice via REST API endpoints.  
No API Gateway or BFF layer is used in this setup.

### Advantages:
- Simple architecture
- Easy to develop and test services independently
- Clear service boundaries and responsibilities
